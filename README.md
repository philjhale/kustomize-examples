# Kustomize examples

[Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) examples for a brown bag.

These YAML files are not designed to be deployable or very realistic. All values are meaningless.

# Examples
- Simple - A basic example using a couple of customisations
- Environments - How you might use Kustomize to alter yaml for different environments
- Kitchen sink - A sample with a whole bunch of customisations

# Building

Run `build.sh`.

The resulting yaml is stored in the `outputs` directorys.
